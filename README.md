Design and develop a program in C# console that meets the following requirements:

- • The program will generate a sequence of randomly chosen numbers between 1 – 100. The sequence will consist of 20 elements.
- • Your program should display the sequence once it is generated.
- • Then, it will display all prime numbers within this sequence.
- • The program will then create a new sequence of all multiples of 3 from the first sequence.
- • Another sequence of all multiples of 5 should be created.
- • If there are no multiples of 3 or 5, then a suitable message should be displayed.
